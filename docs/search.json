    "text": "To start, we want to investigate what you did by hand; how many words in each film were positive? How many were negative?\n\nCounting Sentiments for Each Film\nThe following code can be run by clicking the green play button on the right.\nThis first part gets the sentiments from a dictionary, just like you did!\n\nsentiments &lt;- \n  SW_movie_scripts |&gt; \n  inner_join(get_sentiments('bing')) # This does what you did for each word for every line in the original 3 films\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(word)`\n\nsentiments  |&gt; slice_head(n=5) |&gt; kable()\n\n\n\n\ncharacter\nmovie\nword\nsentiment\n\n\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\nmadness\nnegative\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\ndoomed\nnegative\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\nbetter\npositive\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\ntrust\npositive\n\n\nImperial Officer\nEpisode IV\ndeath\nnegative\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the count function counts how many positive and negative words for each film.\n\nsentiment_counts &lt;-\n  sentiments |&gt; \n  count(movie,sentiment) # Adds up each positive and negative for each film\n\nsentiment_counts |&gt; slice_head(n=5) |&gt; kable()\n\n\n\n\nmovie\nsentiment\nn\n\n\n\n\nEpisode IV\nnegative\n322\n\n\nEpisode IV\npositive\n391\n\n\nEpisode V\nnegative\n269\n\n\nEpisode V\npositive\n338\n\n\nEpisode VI\nnegative\n268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Sentiment for Each Film\n\n# Make Plots\nggplot(sentiment_counts,aes(x=sentiment,y=n))+ \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  facet_wrap(~movie)+\n  labs(title = \"Star Wars Movie Sentiments\",\n       y = \"Count\",x=\"Bing Sentiment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVader’s Conversations\nI prepared all of the code for you in advance, but Vader doesn’t want you to investigate his “accidentally recorded” conversations. You and your table need to copy and paste the functions in the right order so we can visualize the sentiment of Vader’s conversations.\nYou can see a snippet of the input data by running this chunk:\n\nSW_movie_scripts |&gt; # Sends the data to the next function\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('bing')) |&gt;slice_head(n=5) |&gt; kable()\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(word)`\n\n\n\n\n\ncharacter\nmovie\nword\nsentiment\n\n\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\nmadness\nnegative\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\ndoomed\nnegative\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\nbetter\npositive\n\n\nThreepio\nEpisode IV\ntrust\npositive\n\n\nImperial Officer\nEpisode IV\ndeath\nnegative\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, you need to find the correct order for the filter function, count function and the pair of group_by and slice_max.\nWhen you think you have the functions in the right order, click the “play” button to see if you get a plot showing the frequencies of Vader’s positive and negative sentiment words.\n\n\nAre you fighting for the light or embracing the dark side?\nChange chosen_side with your choice, “light side” or “dark side”. It takes a minute or so to generate.\n\n# replace the quoted text with either `light side` or `dark side`\n\ncreate_SW_Wordcloud(\"light side\")\n\nWarning in wordcloud_boxes(data_points = points_valid_first, boxes = boxes, :\nSome words could not fit on page. They have been removed."
