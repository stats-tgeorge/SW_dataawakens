## Introduction's

-   Professor Tyler George

-   Student Robin Gillette

## Famous Quotes

-   Who has a favorite Star Wars quote?

-   Would you say that quote is positive or negative? 

-   Famous quotes, according to [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-star-wars-quotes/may-the-force-be-with-you-3/)
    * Luke, I am your father
    * Just kidding, that is not actually the real quote! 

## Text Analysis

-   A popular technique in Data Science is **text analysis**.

-   What do you think **text analysis** is (beyond *analysis of text*)?

## Sentiment Analysis

-   Today you will all be trying your hand at a type of text analysis called **sentiment analysis**.

-   Any educated guesses on what **sentiment analysis** is?

## Activity {.smaller}

-   At each of your tables, you have:
    -   Star Wars Movie quotes
    -   What we call a **lexicon** dictionary of sentiments.
        -   This one is called [*Bing*](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)
        -   All words are either positive or negative

## Activity Instructions {.smaller}

-   Fill in the table with each word of your quotes on the left and their sentiment (positive or negative) on the right.

-   Count the number of positives and negatives and write your totals at the bottom.

-   Scan the QR code and enter your movie (IV, V, or VI). Then, you'll see the number of positive sentiment words and negative sentiment words in your quotes.
    
    - If extra sheets are lying around, feel free to work on those quotes, too!
    
    - You can also respond at [bit.ly/SWTDASent](bit.ly/SWTDASent).

## Let's Dive Deeper {.smaller}

-   What would we need to do if we wanted to understand the sentiment of a character or a movie as a whole?

-   At each table is 1 computer connected to the TVs at those desks.

-   Each computer has a program called RStudio on the screen, which allows you to program in the language R.

-   R is a statistical analysis programming language and is one of the two most common languages in the field of data science (Python is the other)

## What you will need... {.smaller}

A *row* of a dataset runs left to right. A *column* of a dataset is verticle (think the lettered columns in a Google Sheet).

- filter: This function is keeping rows with words spoken by "Vader"

- count: This function is counting how many times each word appeared

- group_by and slice_max: These functions are taking the counts, keeping the top 5 most common words that have positive sentiment and that have negative sentiment. 






## A More Advanced Analysis

- Dennis Bakhuis scraped all of Wookipedias information on Star Wars

- He posted all of his work [HERE](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/wookieepediascience). 

- One amazing result is a [network plot](https://dennisbakhuis.github.io/wookieepediascience/).

## Data Science and Statistics at Cornell

- Courses take advantage of the block plan were we can learn and practice a concept in class.

- Interactive labs in most of our major courses. 

- Competitions, conferneces, socials and more.
